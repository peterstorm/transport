# transport

CLI app for saving paths in the terminal, so you can quickly jump to them!

It uses the transport.sh script that you have to `source` into your shell.

## Commands
`tp add [name] [path] -- path is optional and if left blank will be set to current working directory`  

`tp list              -- lists current saved paths`  

`tp remove [name]     -- remove a path from your saved paths`  

`tp tp [name]         -- transport to saved path!`
